### Date

Oct 9, 2020 - 9pm

### Location of deployed application

### Time spent

7 hours (4 hours for meeting all requirements and the 3 hours for refining and adding bonus functionalities)

### Assumptions made

- You're running my project in a browser environment.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made

- Some parts of the code could be refactored for better project maintenability.
- Didn't had time to test launch navigator on a real device (but I hope it works =D)
- Used Recharts library, even though I discovered that it doesn't work pretty well with Hooks (see console warnings). I'd use another library in a real environment.
- I'd probably go with MobX in a real application of that scope, but since I'm not so skilled with it, I felt that it would be better to stick with redux
- I'd probably use also a dynamic background that changes according to the weather state, but I didn't had time and I didn't find anything useful on the web

### Stretch goals attempted

- Implemented a cross browser web/mobile app: It's ready to run on mobile devices.
- Dynamic weather icon showing on main screen
- Loads current weather, city and location.. not just the forecast.
- Implemented forecast using a beaultiful chart library
- _Nearby things to do feature_: User is able to check which interesting attractions he may visit (intention was correlating this with weather, but didn't fit on the scope)

### Instructions to run assignment locally

- Make sure port 3000 is available
  `yarn start`

- visit localhost:3000

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?

- Nothing that I remember of

### Other information about your submission that you feel it's important that we know if applicable.

### Your feedback on this technical challenge

- This was a simple challenge, but the project is actually interesting. I may carry on with this and publish on Google Play.
